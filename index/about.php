  I'm obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making things better. I've been in the business of creating since I hung my first painting on the fridge when I was 3. After graduating from the University of Kentucky, I've been actively involved in the web design community for the last 5 years. I've designed websites for small businesses, corporations, nonprofits, churches, musicians and more. I also started a design blog, Visual Swirl, where I share inspiration, tutorials, and resources.

<div class="quote_right2">My specialty is front-end web design and development, making pixel magic in photoshop and turning it into beautiful, semantic HTML & CSS. My interests, however, extend beyond the web and I love helping people with branding, print design and marketing strategy. I even love making designs move by creating professional motion graphics.
